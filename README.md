## Official Source Code for OsciQuant
This repository contains the official implementation of **Oscillations Make Neural Networks Robust to Quantization**.

For a detailed explanation of the methodology and results, refer to our paper:

<!--
## Installation
```bash
pip install osciquant
```
-->

## Usage

#### Importing OsciQuant

```python
from osciquant.regularization import OsciQuantLoss
from osciquant.quantizers import UniformQuantizer
from osciquant.handler import attach_weight_quantizers, toggle_quantization
```

#### Attaching Quantizers
```python
attach_weight_quantizers(model=model, 
                         exclude_layers=[], 
                         quantizer=UniformQuantizer(bit_width), 
                         enabled=False)
```
Attaches quantizers to the specified layers of the model. The weights in these layers will be regularized. When `quantized_eval` is set to `True`, the quantized weights are used during the forward pass. `toggle_quantization` changes the state of enabled.
 

#### Training with Regularized Loss
```python
regularized_loss = OsciQuantLoss(base_loss=criterion, 
                                 model=model,
                                 regularization_lambda=1, 
                                 regularization=True)
```
The `OsciQuantLoss` function introduces a regularization term that induces oscillations, making the weights robust to quantization. To validate the model with quantized weights, use `toggle_quantization` before evaluating.


```python
for i in epochs:
    toggle_quantization(model, enabled=False)
    ...
    train_loss = regularized_loss(pred_train, y_train)
    ...
    toggle_quantization(model, enabled=True)
    ...
    quantized_val_loss = criterion(pred_val, y_val)
```

#### Baseline Quantization Methods
To perform Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) attach the quantizers to the specified layers of the model as before, and quantize once after the model has converged. 

```python
from osciquant.quantizers import UniformQuantizer
from osciquant.handler import attach_weight_quantizers, toggle_quantization

BIT = 4  # desired quantization level 
EXCLUDE = []  # quantize all layers
QUANTIZER = UniformQuantizer(bit_width=BIT)

attach_weight_quantizers(model=model, 
                         exclude_layers=EXCLUDE, 
                         quantizer=UniformQuantizer(BIT), 
                         enabled=False)

for i in epochs:
    ...
    ### Normal full precision training
    ...

### Obtain PTQ model
toggle_quantization(model, enabled=True)

### Evaluate using the quantized model
```

## Todo
- feature: function for adding unique quantizer object to each layer (LSQ)
- feature: function for cross-bit accuracy
- bug: If layer is not used in forward, it is still regularized if it has a quantizer attached
